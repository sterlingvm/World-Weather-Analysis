## Overview of Weather-Mapping-Analysis
Travel Organizer PlanMyTrip needs help organizing and recommending idela hotels based on clients' weather preferences. To do so, Jack, the head of Analysis for the User interface team, requests help collect and present data for customers by utilizing API requests to OpenWeatherAPI to receive JSON weather data, performing statistical analyses and linear regression calculations on the models using clients' inputted weather preferences as a filter, cleaning the data, then exporting those responses via GooglePlaces API and JupyterGMaps mapping.

In order to achieve this, our goal is to pull the longitutdes and latitudes for 500 random cities across the world (close to or in cities around the world), request the location names based off of those coordinates, request each location's weather forecasting, plot that data onto a scatter plot, perform analyses and statistical calculations on them (namely central tendency and linear regression calculations), then export/map these coordinates onto a map using GooglePlacesAPI and JupyterGMaps.
